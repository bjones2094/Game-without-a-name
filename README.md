#My game
This is my game I'm making as a hobby project. It runs, so it must be pretty good!
#Objective
Click the dots as they appear, but watch out for the bombs. Pretty simple.
#Usage
Build.bat is used to compile all files into the bin folder. To run the program, enter the bin folder, and use "java Game" to start the game.
